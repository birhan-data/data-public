## Study abstract:

Importance: Although there has been a reduction in stunting (low height/length for age), a proxy of malnutrition, the prevalence of malnutrition in Ethiopia is still high. Child growth patterns and estimates of stunting are needed to increase awareness and resources to improve the potential for recovery.

Objective: Estimate the prevalence, incidence and reversal of stunting among children aged  0-24 months. 

Design: We conducted a children’s cohort study between December 2018 and November 2020.

Setting: The study took place in the Birhan maternal and child health population-based cohort in North Shewa Zone, Amhara Ethiopia. 

Participants: Among the 4,354 children aged 0-24 months enrolled during the study period, 3,674 (84.4%) who had their length measured at least once were included. 

Main outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of this study was stunting, defined as  length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) below -2 SD. 

Results: A total of 4,354 children were enrolled out of which 3,674 (84.4%) had their length measured at least once and were included in this study. Among children included, 82.7% resided in rural areas and 48.7% were female. Our findings indicate that median population-level length is consistently below WHO growth standards from birth to age two. Growth velocity was slowest compared to WHO standards during the neonatal period (-1.4cm/month for girls and -1.6cm/month for boys). The observed prevalence of stunting was highest by age two at 57.4% (95% CI 54.8-60.0%). Incidence of stunting increased over time and reached 51.0% (95% CI 45.3-56.6%) between ages 12 and 24 months. Reversal was 45.2% (95% CI 36.0-54.8%) by age2 years. We found substantial heterogeneity in anthropometric measurements, which we addressed by excluding outliers in sensitivity analyses using modeled growth trajectories for each child. 

Conclusion: The evidence from this study highlights a chronically malnourished population with much of the burden driven by growth faltering during the neonatal periods as well as after 6 months of age. To end all forms of malnutrition, growth faltering in populations such as that in young children in Amhara, Ethiopia needs to be addressed.
