This directory contains analysis code for the paper entitled **Development of prediction models for antenatal care attendance in North Shewa Zone, Ethiopia**. The published paper can be accessed here: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2805447. 

All models were trained to predict risk of failure to attend antenatal care. Analysis code is in .R format.

### Study abstract:
**Background.** In low-resource settings, coverage of at least four antenatal care (ANC) visits remains low. As a first step towards enhancing ANC attendance, this study aims to develop a series of predictive models to identify women who are at high risk of failing to attend ANC in a rural setting in Ethiopia.

**Methods.** This is a cohort study conducted in the Birhan field site, North Shewa Zone. Using data of a surveillance system and a pregnancy cohort, we developed and internally validated a series of logistic regressions with regularization (LASSO), and ensembles of decision trees. Discrimination was estimated using the area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (AUC). Three prediction time points were considered: conception, and gestational weeks 13 and 24.

**Results.** The study sample size was 2195.  Mean age of participants was 26.8 years (Standard Deviation (SD) 6.1) and mean gestational age at enrollment was 25.5 weeks (SD 8.8). A total of 582 women (26.5%) failed to attend ANC during cohort follow-up. We observed AUC in the range of 0.61-0.70, with higher values for models predicting at weeks 13 and 24. All AUC values were similar with slightly higher performance for the ensembles of decision trees.

**Conclusions.** The developed models may be useful to identify women at high risk of missing their ANC visits to target interventions to improve attendance rates. This study calls for new efforts to generate data that enables accurate prediction of ANC access, and it opens the possibility to develop and validate easy-to-use tools to predict health-related behaviors in settings with scarce resources.
