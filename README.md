# Birhan Public Repository (TEST - CURRENTLY PRIVATE)
This is the public repository of the **HaSET team**. Its objective is to share code and outputs of research studies performed in the context of the Birhan projects.

Each study with public code or outputs has a separate folder named with the title of the paper where results are reported. Please, note that if you decide the clone this repository, all folders will be downloaded to your computer. You may want to save single files by right clicking the *Raw* button at the top right corner of the file page of the specific script you are interested in, or by directly downloading objects.

Each folder includes a text file with the abstract of the study, a short description of the different public files and how to use them.
